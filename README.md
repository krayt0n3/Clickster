# Clickster
The purpose of this project is to be able to click an image, increment the count and shuffle the image after you've clicked it. 
I was able to complete everything except restarting the game if it triggered an image ypu'd already clicked. The methods I tried 
were checking each id of the image that you clicked and pushing that id into an empty array. If the id in the array checked against 
the current id checked your score would go to zero and the game would start again.
